```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

Question 1)
```{r}
ratings <- choco$Rating
hist(ratings)
```
The ratings are centered around 3 with a skew no ratings at five making the plot slightly skewed.

Question 2) 
```{r}
cocoPercent <- choco$Cocoa.Pct
plot(cocoPercent,ratings)
```
Looking at the scatterplot and not doing any advanced analysis there doesnt not appear to be any trend in the data, this means that there is not a connection between ratings and coco percent
