```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

Question 1) 
```{r}
date <- choco$Review.Date
ratings <- choco$Rating
locations <- choco$Company.Location

numChoco <- length(ratings)
numChoco
```
There are 1852 chocolate bars that have been rated




Question 2)
```{r}
counts<-table(choco$Review.Date)
plot(date,ratings)
barplot(counts)

```
The number of ratings increased with year up until 2016 when it started to drop. 

Question 3)

Question 3
```{r}
counts <- table(choco$Company.Location, choco$Rating)
counts
```
The top three countries are The USA, Canada, and France, then looking at the table we can see all three countires have the most ratings at 3.5 and the a "normalish" spread about that point. Except for the us is has two peaks in its data, it also has the most data points which would be the cause.
