## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r choco}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
hist(choco$Rating)
summary(choco)
```
The ratings are centered at 3 with a slight skew to the left. I do not see any outliers. 
```{r percentage}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating)
```
Ratings do not depend on cacao percentage because as cacao percentage increases in the graph above you see that the rating is the same as if it had not increased meaining there is no clear correltation.
